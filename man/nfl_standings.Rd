nfl_standings(
  games,
  ...,
  ranks = c("CONF", "DIV", "DRAFT", "NONE"),

\arguments{
\item{games}{A data frame containing real or simulated game scores. The
following variables are required:
\describe{
\item{sim or season}{A simulation ID. Normally 1 - n simulated seasons.}
\item{game_type}{One of 'REG', 'WC', 'DIV', 'CON', 'SB' indicating if a
game was a regular season game or one of the playoff rounds.}
\item{week}{The week of the corresponding NFL season.}
\item{away_team}{Team abbreviation of the away team (please see
\code{\link{divisions}} for valid team abbreviations).}
\item{home_team}{Team abbreviation of the home team (please see
\code{\link{divisions}} for valid team abbreviations).}
\item{result}{Equals home score - away score.}
}}

\item{...}{currently not used}

\item{ranks}{One of \code{"DIV"}, \code{"CONF"}, \code{"DRAFT"}, or \code{"NONE"} to specify
which ranks - and thus the associated tiebreakers - are to be determined.
\itemize{
\item \code{"DIV"}: Adds the division ranking variable \code{div_rank}
\item \code{"CONF"} (default): \code{"DIV"} + the conference variable \code{conf_rank}. For better
performance, it is possible to set \code{playoff_seeds} to a value < 16 to make
the function skip tiebreakers of irrelevant conference ranks.
\item \code{"DRAFT"}: \code{"CONF"} + the draft variable \code{draft_rank}. This is the actual
pick in the draft based off game results. No trades of course.
}}

\item{tiebreaker_depth}{One of \code{"SOS"}, \code{"PRE-SOV"}, or \code{"RANDOM"}. Controls
which tiebreakers are to be applied. The implemented tiebreakers are
documented here \url{https://nflseedr.com/articles/tiebreaker.hmtl}.
The values mean:
\itemize{
\item \code{"SOS"} (default): Apply all tiebreakers through Strength of Schedule. If there are
still remaining ties, break them through coin toss.
\item \code{"PRE-SOV"}: Apply all tiebreakers before Strength of Victory. If there are
still remaining ties, break them through coin toss. Why Pre SOV? It's the
first tiebreaker that requires knowledge of how OTHER teams played.
\item \code{"RANDOM"}: Breaks all tiebreakers with a coin toss. I don't really know,
why I allow this...
}}

\item{playoff_seeds}{If \code{NULL} (the default), will compute all 16 conference
ranks. This means, the function applies conference tiebreakers to all
conference ranks. For better performance, it is possible to set this to a
value < 16 to make the function skip tiebreakers of those conference ranks.}

\item{verbosity}{One of \code{"MIN"}, \code{"MAX"}, or \code{"NONE"} allowing the user
to set the grade of verbosity of status reports. They mean:
\itemize{
\item \code{"MIN"} (default): Prints main steps of the process.
\item \code{"MAX"}: Prints all steps of the complete tiebreaking process.
\item \code{"NONE"}: No status reports at all. Do this to maximize the performance.
}}
}
