<p>NFL tiebreaking procedures for division ranks and conference seeds
are documented <a href="https://www.nfl.com/standings/tie-breaking-procedures" class="external-link">on the
NFL.com website</a> and <a href="https://operations.nfl.com/the-rules/nfl-tie-breaking-procedures/" class="external-link">on
the NFL Football Operations website</a>. They are mostly identical, but
not exactly<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-content="&lt;p&gt;Yes, you are reading right. And the difference is huge
when you try to efficiently code the process, smh. NFL Football Ops
prefaces the wildcard tiebreaking process for 3 or more clubs with
&lt;em&gt;Note: If two clubs remain tied after a third club or other clubs are
eliminated, the tiebreaker reverts to step 1 of the applicable two-club
format.&lt;/em&gt; NFL.com adds a second - very important - sentence to this,
which is &lt;em&gt;If three clubs remain tied after a fourth club is
eliminated during any step, tiebreaker restarts at Step 2 of three-club
format.&lt;/em&gt; That’s a big difference because the first part of that
section sounds like we are only allowed to restart the process if two
clubs remain tied. But we actually have to restart every time a team is
eliminated. That’s good news because it is easier to code.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Draft pick assignment is also documented <a href="https://www.nfl.com/standings/tie-breaking-procedures" class="external-link">on the
NFL.com website</a> and <a href="https://operations.nfl.com/journey-to-the-nfl/the-nfl-draft/the-rules-of-the-draft/" class="external-link">on
the NFL Football Operations website</a>. However, the author is of the
opinion that both texts are so cumbersome and misleadingly worded that
he has written his own summary instead.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Only one club advances to the playoffs in any tie-breaking step.
Remaining tied clubs revert to the first step of the applicable division
or Wild Card tie-breakers. As an example, if two clubs remain tied in
any tie-breaker step after all other clubs have been eliminated, the
procedure reverts to Step 1 of the two-club format to determine the
winner. When one club wins the tiebreaker, all other clubs revert to
Step 1 of the applicable two-club or three-club format.</li>
<li>In comparing records against common opponents among tied teams, the
best won-lost-tied percentage is the deciding factor, since teams may
have played an unequal number of games.</li>
<li>To determine home field priority among division winners, apply Wild
Card tiebreakers.</li>
<li>To determine home field priority for Wild Card qualifiers, apply
division tiebreakers (if teams are from the same division) or Wild Card
tiebreakers (if teams are from different divisions).</li>
<li>To determine the <em>best combined ranking</em> among conference
team’s in points scored and points allowed, add a team’s position in the
two categories, and the lowest score wins. For example, if Team A is
first in points scored and second in points allowed, its combined
ranking is “3.” If Team B is third in points scored and first in points
allowed, its combined ranking is “4.” Team A then wins the tiebreaker.
If two teams are tied for a position, both teams are awarded the ranking
as if they held it solely. For example, if Team A and Team B are tied
for first in points scored, each team is assigned a ranking of “1” in
that category, and if Team C is third, its ranking will still be
“3.”</li>

</h2>
<p><em>This is used to calculate the variable
<code>draft_rank</code></em></p>
<p>The order of selection is determined by the reverse order of finish
in the previous season. Barring any trades between clubs, each round
starts with the team that finished with the worst record and ends with
the Super Bowl champions.</p>
<p>Picks are assigned by win percentage in ascending order as
follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Clubs not participating in the playoffs shall select in the first
through 18th positions.</li>
<li>The losers of the Wild Card games shall select in the 19th through
24th positions.</li>
<li>The losers of the Divisional playoff games shall select in the 25th
through 28th positions.</li>
<li>The losers of the Conference Championship games shall select 29th
and 30th.</li>
<li>The winner of the Super Bowl game shall select last and the Super
Bowl loser will select next-to-last.</li>
</ol>
<p>In situations where teams finished the previous season with identical
win percentage, the determination of draft position is decided by
strength of schedule — the aggregate winning percentage of a team’s
opponents. The team that played the schedule with the lowest winning
percentage will be awarded the earlier pick.</p>
<p>If the teams have the same strength of schedule, division or
conference tiebreakers are applied first.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="divisional-draft-pick-tie">Divisional Draft Pick Tie<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#divisional-draft-pick-tie"></a>
</h3>
<p>If all teams tied for a pick are from the same division, then the
division rank is used. The lower division rank gets the earlier
pick.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="conference-draft-pick-tie">Conference Draft Pick Tie<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#conference-draft-pick-tie"></a>

<p>If all teams tied for a pick are from the same conference, then the

pick.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="inter-conference-draft-pick-tie">Inter-Conference Draft Pick Tie<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#inter-conference-draft-pick-tie"></a>
</h3>
<p>If the divisional or conference tiebreakers are not applicable, or
ties still exist between teams of different conferences, ties will be
broken by the following procedure:</p>
<p>Ties involving THREE OR MORE clubs from different conferences will be
broken by applying</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>divisional tiebreakers to determine the lowest-ranked team in a
division,</li>
<li>conference tiebreakers to determine the lowest-ranked team within a
conference.</li>
</ol>
<p>After this process, there can only be 2 inter-conference teams
participating in the following steps (draft pick assignment is reversed
to division or conference ties. Worse teams get earlier picks):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Head-to-head, if applicable. The loser gets the earlier pick.</li>
<li>Worst won-lost-tied percentage in common games (minimum of
four).</li>
<li>Worst Strength of victory in all games.</li>
<li>Worst combined ranking among all teams in points scored and points
allowed in all games.</li>
<li>Worst net points in all games.</li>
<li>Worst net touchdowns in all games.</li>
