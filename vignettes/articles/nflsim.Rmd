```{r, include = FALSE}

# Running a Simulation

Loading the package is obligatory, so it is done first (along with `dplyr` for data wrangling and the `pipe`):

```{r setup}
library(nflseedR)
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
options(digits = 3)
```

_Note: For this guide, we'll set an initial random seed of `4` at the beginning and `simulations = 100`
for the purposes of this document so you can follow along by entering the same code and get
the same results shown here. We'll also set `fresh_season = TRUE` to blank out the existing results
from the 2020 season, but normally when simulating an incomplete season, you wouldn't do these things._

```{r}
set.seed(4)
sims <- simulate_nfl(
  nfl_season = 2020,
  fresh_season = TRUE,
  simulations = 100
)
```

The output contains a lot of pre-aggregated information, as well as the individual
results from each game of each simulation. For example, let's look at the overall
results for the Bears:

```{r}
sims$overall |> dplyr::filter(team == "CHI") |> knitr::kable()
```

We can see the Bears got 10.8 wins on average. They made the playoffs 87% of simulations, won the division in 39%, won the Super Bowl in 4%, and only in 1% did they receive a top five draft pick. The `teams` section of the output will show how a team did in each simulated season. 

```{r}
sims$teams |>
  dplyr::filter(team == "CHI") |>
  dplyr::select(sim, team, wins, seed, draft_order) |> 
  utils::head(6) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

Let's check out the playoff games from the first simulation, where the Bears went 10-6 and got the 6th seed.

```{r}
sims$games |> dplyr::filter(sim == 1, game_type != "REG") |> knitr::kable()
```

In this simulation, the Bears beat the Rams in a wildcard game by 26 points, then
beat the Cowboys in the divisional round by 11 points, took the Eagles by a field goal in
the NFC Championship Game, and finally defeated the Patriots by 6 in the Super Bowl.

As you may have gathered at this point, the default simulation code picks a random
Elo for every team, and uses those as the starting Elo ratings for all 32 teams.
However, the default code Elo will adjust independently within each simulation as
each week is simulated. (The Elo model used is loosely based off of that of
[FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-our-nfl-predictions-work/).)

## Use Your Own Model

But of course the real value of nflseedR is putting in your own model into the simulator.
To accomplish this, you can write your own function which will determine the output of
games instead. As an example, here's a very stupid model that makes the team earlier
alphabetically win by 3 points 90% of the time, and lose by 3 points the other 10% of
the time.

```{r}
stupid_games_model <- function(teams, games, week_num, ...) {
  # make the earlier alphabetical team win 90% of the time
  games <- games |>
    dplyr::mutate(
      result = dplyr::case_when(
        !is.na(result) | week != week_num ~ result,
        away_team < home_team ~ sample(c(-3, 3), n(), prob = c(0.9, 0.1), replace = TRUE),
        away_team > home_team ~ sample(c(-3, 3), n(), prob = c(0.1, 0.9), replace = TRUE),
        TRUE ~ 0
      )
    )
  
  # return values
  return(list(teams = teams, games = games))
}
```

When you create this function, the first two inputs are data on the teams (one row
per team per sim), and data on the games (one row per game per sim). The third argument
is the week number currently being simulated, as only one week is processed at a time.

Your function's job - by whatever means you choose - is to update the `result` column for
that week's games in each of the sims with the number of points the home team won by
(or lost by if negative, or 0 if the game ended in a tie).

It returns both the `teams` and the `games` data. It does both because this way you can
store information in new columns by team or by game to use in the next call. Make sure
your code both accepts and returns the appropriate information, or the simulator will
break!

For example, the default function updates a team's Elo after the game, and stores it
in the `teams` data. When the simulator processes the next week, it uses the updated Elo
rating to inform the team's next game.

!! Also, make sure you aren't overriding completed games or games that aren't in the current
week of `w`. The simulator will **not** stop you from setting past, present, or future
game results in your function, whether you meant to do so or not. !!

Let's run a simulation with `stupid_games_model` and see what happens:

```{r}
sims2 <- simulate_nfl(
  nfl_season = 2020,
  process_games = stupid_games_model,
  fresh_season = TRUE,
  simulations = 100
)

sims2$overall |> dplyr::arrange(team) |> utils::head() |> knitr::kable()
sims2$overall |> dplyr::arrange(team) |> utils::tail() |> knitr::kable()
```

As you might expect, the earliest alphabetical teams win a lot. The Cardinals
won the Super Bowl in 59% of seasons! Meanwhile, the teams at the bottom
alphabetically are virtually certain to be at the top of the draft order.

## Adding In Your Own Data

This is all well and good, you might be thinking, but your model works off of
other data not in the simulator! How can that work? This is where we utilize R's
ability to have generic arguments.

The `...` at the end of the function definition means that the function can be
called with any number of additional arguments. You can name these whatever you
want, as long as they're not already the name of other defined arguments.

When you call the `simulate_nfl()` function, it too uses the `...` syntax, which
allows you to pass in any number of additional arguments to the function. The
simulator will in turn pass these on to *your* function that processes games.

For example, let's slightly modify our last example:

```{r}
biased_games_model <- function(teams, games, week_num, ...) {
  
  # arguments
  args <- list(...)
  best <- ""
  worst <- ""
  
  # best team?
  if ("best" %in% names(args)) {
    best <- args$best
  }
  
  # worst team?
  if ("worst" %in% names(args)) {
    worst <- args$worst
  }

  # make the best team always win and the worst team always lose
  # otherwise, make the earlier alphabetical team win 90% of the time
  games <- games |>
    dplyr::mutate(
      result = dplyr::case_when(
        !is.na(result) | week != week_num ~ result,
        away_team == best | home_team == worst ~ -3,
        away_team == worst | home_team == best ~ 3,
        away_team < home_team ~ sample(c(-3, 3), n(), prob = c(0.9, 0.1), replace = TRUE),
        away_team > home_team ~ sample(c(-3, 3), n(), prob = c(0.1, 0.9), replace = TRUE),
        TRUE ~ 0
      )
    )
  
  # return values
  return(list(teams = teams, games = games))
}
```

This allows us to define `best` and `worst`, and use that information to
determine a result (in this case, have the best team always win and the 
worst team always lose). While `best` and `worst` are in this example
single-length character vectors, they can be data frames or any other R
data type.

Let's simulate using this:

```{r}
sims3 <- simulate_nfl(
  nfl_season = 2020,
  process_games = biased_games_model, 
  fresh_season = TRUE, 
  simulations = 100,
  best = "CHI", 
  worst = "GB"
)
```

Now let nflseedR summarize the simulation for you by using `summary()` with the nflseedR simulation object. This will print a gt table.

```{r}
summary(sims3)
```

And this shows exactly what we expect. By defining the Bears as the best team,
they always go 16-0, win the division, and win the Super Bowl. Interestingly,
they do not always get the #1 seed. This makes sense, however, as in games 
without the Bears or the Packers, the alphabetically earlier teams still wins 
90% of the time. The Cardinals would therefore be expected to go 16-0 in some
of the simulations, and in some of those have thee tiebreakers over the Bears.
However, even in these simulations, they'll still lose to Bears in the end
when they meet in the playoffs.

Similarly, the Packers always go 0-16, and never make the playoffs. While in
these simulated seasons they got the #1 draft pick every time, they aren't 
guaranteed to do so. Using the same logic as above, sometimes the Washington
Commanders will go 0-16 too, and may beat the Packers out for the #1 pick
through tiebreakers.

## Passing Data in from One Week to the Next

Sometimes though you want your data to keep updating as the simulation progresses.
For example, an Elo-based model that updates each team's Elo after each game. You
can pass in the starting Elo values per team, and as games are simulated, update
the Elo values for each team and store them in the `teams` data. This column will
be part of the `teams` data passed into your function when the following week is
simulated and your function is called.

Read the comments in the code below for specific tips on doing this but here are good ones:

* You can add columns to `teams` and/or `games` if you want.
* When doing joins to do the above, do left joins to make sure no rows are removed.
* Remove any "helper" columns you generate along the way you don't actually need before returning.
* Make sure any column doesn't get blindly joined on so it has `.x` and `.y` versions in Week 2 and R throws an error because an expected column name doesn't exist.
* Make sure you only update games with `is.na(result) & week == week_num`! You don't want to override completed games, or games from a week other than the current week being simulated.

```{r}
elo_model <- function(teams, games, week_num, ...) {

  # round out (away from zero)
  # this way the simulator never simulates a tie
  # the simulator will still allow ties to be simulated if you want
  # ... but not on playoff games
  round_out <- function(x) {
    x[!is.na(x) & x < 0] <- floor(x[!is.na(x) & x < 0])
    x[!is.na(x) & x > 0] <- ceiling(x[!is.na(x) & x > 0])
    return(x)
  }

  # we're going to store elo as a new columns in the teams data
  # it won't start off there of course, so we need to determine it
  # from our arguments
  if (!("elo" %in% colnames(teams))) {
    args <- list(...)
    if ("elo" %in% names(args)) {
      # pull the elo info from custom arguments
      teams <- teams |>
        dplyr::inner_join(args$elo |> dplyr::select(team, elo), by = c("team" = "team"))
    } else {
      # error with a friendly error message if no elo data is passed in
      stop("Pass in a tibble `elo` as an argument to `simulate_nfl()`")
    }
  }

  # isolate the ratings data by sim and by team only
  # we will want to join to the games data later and don't want excess columns
  ratings <- teams |> dplyr::select(sim, team, elo)

  # simulate game outcomes
  games <- games |>
    # add in the away team's elo to the game data
    # note we join on both `sim` and the team
    # always join on `sim` to make sure each sim cares about only its data
    dplyr::inner_join(ratings, by = c("sim" = "sim", "away_team" = "team")) |>
    dplyr::rename(away_elo = elo) |>
    # repeat for the home team as well
    dplyr::inner_join(ratings, by = c("sim" = "sim", "home_team" = "team")) |>
    dplyr::rename(home_elo = elo) |>
    dplyr::mutate(
      # calculate the elo difference
      elo_diff = home_elo - away_elo,
      # add in a small HFA amount if played at home
      elo_diff = elo_diff + ifelse(location == "Home", 20, 0),
      # make an adjustment for rest
      elo_diff = elo_diff + (home_rest - away_rest) / 7 * 25,
      # playoff games swing elo more
      elo_diff = elo_diff * ifelse(game_type == "REG", 1, 1.2),
      # from elo, we calculate the home team's win percentage
      wp = 1 / (10^(-elo_diff / 400) + 1),
      # we also can calculate the estimate (mean points home team wins by)
      estimate = elo_diff / 25,
      result = dplyr::case_when(
        # !!! ALWAYS DO THIS NEXT LINE IN YOUR `result` CHANGES !!!
        # you have to make sure you're only changing unfinished games in current week
        # if you don't do this, it will usually error out on a friendly error message
        is.na(result) & week == week_num ~ 
          as.integer(round_out(rnorm(n(), estimate, 13))),
        # if not this week or known result, leave as-is
        TRUE ~ as.integer(result)
      ),
      # simplify to 1 = win, 0 = loss, 0.5 = tie to help calculate elo shift
      outcome = dplyr::case_when(
        is.na(result) ~ NA_real_,
        result > 0 ~ 1,
        result < 0 ~ 0,
        TRUE ~ 0.5
      ),
      # calculate the amount to adjust home team's elo by
      elo_input = dplyr::case_when(
        is.na(result) ~ NA_real_,
        result > 0 ~ elo_diff * 0.001 + 2.2,
        result < 0 ~ -elo_diff * 0.001 + 2.2,
        TRUE ~ 1.0,
      ),
      elo_mult = log(pmax(abs(result), 1) + 1.0) * 2.2 / elo_input,
      elo_shift = 20 * elo_mult * (outcome - wp)
    ) |>
    # we don't want these columns in `games` any more
    # remove any columns you don't need when you're done
    # otherwise the next week they'll get joined as `col.x` and `col.y`
    # which will almost certainly break your script
    dplyr::select(
      -away_elo, -home_elo, -elo_diff, -wp, -estimate,
      -outcome, -elo_input, -elo_mult
    )

  # apply elo shifts
  teams <- teams |>
    # join games results from this week to away teams (within same sim!)
    # note this is a LEFT join, we don't want to remove any teams rows
    dplyr::left_join(games |>
        dplyr::filter(week == week_num) |>
        dplyr::select(sim, away_team, elo_shift),
      by = c("sim" = "sim", "team" = "away_team")
    ) |>
    # away team's elo gets subtracted by elo amount
    # if the team wasn't an away team, do nothing
    dplyr::mutate(elo = elo - ifelse(!is.na(elo_shift), elo_shift, 0)) |>
    # we don't want to keep `elo_shift` in `teams` either, remove it
    dplyr::select(-elo_shift) |>
    # repeat the above except now do it for the home team
    dplyr::left_join(games |>
        dplyr::filter(week == week_num) |>
        dplyr::select(sim, home_team, elo_shift),
      by = c("sim" = "sim", "team" = "home_team")
    ) |>
    # note that a team on a bye will have `elo_shift` as NA for both joins
    # this means it won't change, which is what we want
    dplyr::mutate(elo = elo + ifelse(!is.na(elo_shift), elo_shift, 0)) |>
    dplyr::select(-elo_shift)

  # we need to keep `elo_shift` out of `games` too and we're done with it
  games <- games |>
    dplyr::select(-elo_shift)

  # return the updated teams and games information
  # note that `teams` will now have an updated `elo` column which will
  # be used for the next week's games
  # note that starting `elo` values are the same per-team... 
  # ... but after that will differ per sim depending on that sim's results
  return(list(teams = teams, games = games))
}
```

Let's generate initial random Elo values for each team. To see how this works,
we'll supply an `test_week = 3` as an argument into `simulate_nfl()` which will
abort after simulating Week 3, and instead return the result of our `elo_model()`
function. 

```{r}
initial_elo <- tibble::tibble(
  team = unique(nflseedR::divisions$team),
  elo = rnorm(length(unique(nflseedR::divisions$team)), 1500, 150)
)
test <- simulate_nfl(
  nfl_season = 2020,
  process_games = elo_model,
  elo = initial_elo,
  fresh_season = TRUE,
  test_week = 3
)
```

Let's look at the Bears' Elo after Week 3 in the top handful of simulations:

```{r}
test$teams |>
  dplyr::filter(team == "CHI") |>
  utils::head() |>
  knitr::kable()
```

You can see that different simulations have different Elo results for the Bears, as 
the simulated seasons had different results for the games, and the Elos were adjusted accordingly.

Let's examine the Bears' games in that first simulation:

```{r}
test$games |>
  filter(sim == 1) |>
  filter(away_team == "CHI" | home_team == "CHI")
```

Note that only the first three weeks have the result filled in, while the others are `NA`,
indicating that game hasn't yet occurred or been simulated. This is because the
`test_week = 3` input aborted the simulation after Week 3, which was useful for seeing
the Elo above.

## Simulation Configuration

There is a lot of flexibility in how you choose to run the simulation. These are
the parameters and how to configure them when you run the `simulate_nfl()` function.

* **nfl_season** - Which NFL season are you simulating? By default, it simulates
the most recent season for which the regular season schedule is available through
[Lee Sharpe's NFL game data](https://github.com/nflverse/nfldata/tree/master/data). The earliest season you can simulate is 2002.
 * Note: Before the schedule for a new season is released, nflseedR may support simulating using a fake schedule for the upcoming season. It will notify you if it is doing this. The opponents will be correct, but the weeks in which games occur will not match the actual NFL schedule. The actual schedule will be utilized instead after it is released by the NFL.
* **process_games** - This is where you supply a function you've written to encompass
your model used to determine simulated games results, like the examples above. By
default, this will generate a random Elo for every team per round of simulations, then
use that to determine game data.
* **playoff_seeds** - How many playoff seeds per conference are used? By default, this
is 7 for seasons 2020 and later, and 6 for earlier seasons.
* **if_ended_today** - This should only be used when running in the middle of the
regular season. It will take all completed games as done, but remove the rest of the
regular season games from the schedule, and begin the playoffs as if everything was
locked in based on the regular season data that exists so far.
* **fresh_season** - You'll see this was set to `TRUE` in all of our examples above.
This setting deletes any playoff games and clears out the results for all regular 
season games, so everything is generated fresh. The default is `FALSE` where all games
that have been completed in real life are treated as locked in, and instead remaining
games are simulated.
* **fresh_playoffs** - Similar to `fresh_season`, except instead when set to `TRUE`,
regular season results remain and only playoff games are deleted and then simulated.
The default is `FALSE` in which case playoff games that are completed are accepted
as they occurred,
* **tiebreaker_depth** - How far do you want tiebreakers to be utilized? Usually 
leaving it at the default below (`3`) is fine, but before the season starts, you
may wish to have less tie-breaking in order to 
  * `1`: All teams with the same record have any ties broken randomly.
  * `2`: Instead of evaluating common games if that step is reached, break any ties
randomly. But all earlier tiebreakers are handled correctly.
  * `3`: The default. All tiebreakers are handled through strength of schedule are
processed (or through strength of victory for draft pick order). In the unlikely
event of a further tie, it will be broken randomly.
* **test_week** - This will abort after simulating this week number in the simulator.
`simulate_nfl()` instead will return the output of your `process_games()` function. This
is a useful input for debugging your code, but should be left as `NULL` (the default) for
actual simulations. This also means only the first round will be simulated.
* **simulations** - How many simulations should be run? Defaults to 1000.
* **sims_per_round** - The simulator can break things up into chunks of simulated
seasons, process each chunk on its own (called a round), and then aggregate everything
together at the end. The default value determines the number of locally available 
cores and calculates the number of simulations per round to be equal to half of 
the available cores (various benchmarks showed this results in optimal performance
in parallel processes). If your computer is hanging and forces a restart while 
running this simulation, it is recommended that you lower this number.

## Simulation Output

The output of `simulate_nfl()`, assuming you don't put in a `test_week` to debug
your function, is a list of class `"nflseedR_simulation"` that holds four data frames with simulation results as well as a list of parameters used in the simulation. Here are the contents of each:

* **teams** - One row per team per simulation.
  * **sim** - The ID number of the simulation. All rows with the same value of `sim` in both `teams` and `games` refer to the same simulated season.
  * **team** - The abbreviation representing the team
  * **conf** - The conference the team is in (such as `AFC`)
  * **division** - The division the team is in (such as `NFC West`)
  * **games** - How many regular season games the team has played
  * **wins** - The number of games the team has won, counting ties as 0.5 wins
  * **true_wins** - The number of games the team has won, ignoring ties.
  * **win_pct** - The win rate of the team. Equal to `wins / games`.
  * **div_pct** - The win rate of the teams in games played against teams in the same division.
  * **conf_pct** - The win rate of the teams in games played against teams in the same conference.
  * **sov** - Strength of Victory. The combined win rate of teams this team has beaten.
  * **sos** - Strength of Schedule. The combined win rate of teams this team has played.
  * **div_rank** - What place the team finished in its division.
  * **seed** - What playoff seed number the team earned. `NA` if the team did not make the playoffs.
  * **exit** - The week of the team's last game. The Super Bowl winner's value will be one higher than the week of the Super Bowl.
  * **draft_order** - Which pick the team earned in the following NFL Draft. Note that this value is before any trades, forfeits, or other modifications to draft picks.
  
* **games** - One row per game per simulation.
  * **sim** - The ID number of the simulation. All rows with the same value of `sim` in both `teams` and `games` refer to the same simulated season.
  * **game_type** - What type of game this is
    * `REG` - A regular season game
    * `POST` - A playoff rounds earlier than a wildcard game (only used if simulating with lots of playoff teams)
    * `WC` - A wildcard playoff game
    * `DIV` - A divisional playoff game
    * `CON` - A conference championship game
    * `SB` - A Super Bowl
  * **week** - The numerical week the game takes place in. Continues incrementing after the regular season to each playoff round.
  * **away_team** - The abbreviation of the away team in the game
  * **home_team** - The abbreviation of the home team in the game
  * **away_rest** - The number of days since the away team's last game. Is `7` for the team's first game of the season.
  * **home_rest** - The number of days since the home team's last game. Is `7` for the team's first game of the season.
  * **location** - Either `Home` if played at the home team's stadium, or `Neutral` for a game played elsewhere
  * **result** - The amount of points the home team won by (or lost by if negative). Is `0` for tied games. It is `NA` for games which aren't yet complete or simulated, which should only ever be returned if you used `test_week`. 

* **overall** - One row per team, aggregated across all simulations. Sorted by `conf` then `division` then `team`. This is a good reference for looking at futures bets, since this should represents your model's chances of various things happening for each team.
  * **conf** - The conference the team is in (such as `AFC`)
  * **division** - The division the team is in (such as `NFC West`)
  * **team** - The abbreviation representing the team
  * **wins** - The mean (average) number of games won across the simulations, counting ties as 0.5 wins
  * **playoff** - The rate this team made the playoffs across simulations
  * **div1** - The rate this team won the division across simulations
  * **seed1** - The rate this team had the first playoff seed across simulations
  * **won_conf** - The rate this team won its conference across simulations
  * **won_sb** - The rate this team won the Super Bowl across simulations
  * **draft1** - The rate this team received the first pick in the next draft across simulations
  * **draft5** - The rate this team received a top five pick in the next draft across simulations

* **team_wins** - Each team has a row for 0 wins, 0.5 wins, 1 win, 1.5 wins, ... , 15.5 wins, 16 wins. These are aggregated across all simulations and are intending to represent your model's probability for teams being below or above a certain win total, making them an excellent reference for using your model to make win total bets.
  * **team** - The abbreviation representing the team
  * **wins** - A number of wins (either an integer halfway between two integers)
  * **over_prob** - The rate this team had more wins than this number aggregated across simulations. Ties are ignored.
  * **under_prob** - The rate this team had fewer wins than this number aggregated across simulations. Ties are ignored. Note that if `wins` is an integer, `1-over_prob-under_prob` represents the rate at which the team finished at exactly that many wins.

* **game_summary** - One row per game, aggregated across all simulations. Sorted by `game_type` then `week` then `away_team` then `home_team`. 
  * **game_type** - What type of game this is
    * `REG` - A regular season game
    * `POST` - A playoff rounds earlier than a wildcard game (only used if simulating with lots of playoff teams)
    * `WC` - A wildcard playoff game
